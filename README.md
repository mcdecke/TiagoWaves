# TiagoWaves

Run the python notebook in Colab to generate an array of numbers that will be used as motion controls for the Tiago robot.

For example, the 'video.mp4' file was created using notebook, and 'movements.csv' was made using that file.

Then, in the Webots simulator, run the tiago++ robot using the 'tiago_py_controller.py' file as the robots controller and it should look similar to the 'waveVideo.mp4' file.
